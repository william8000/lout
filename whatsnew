    *** IMPORTANT: TWO CHANGES THAT ARE NOT UPWARDLY COMPATIBLE ***

    (1)  The @Abstract symbol in technical reports now comes before the
	 // symbol, not after it.  See User's Guide for details.

    (2)  Setup file arrangements have changed.  You now need to have one
	 @SysInclude line for each package you use.  For example,

	    Previous versions           Version 3.13
	    ---------------------------------------------

	    @SysInclude { eq }          @SysInclude { eq }
	    @SysInclude { ddoc }        @SysInclude { diag }
				        @SysInclude { doc }

         Import clauses in mydefs files also have to change:

	    Previous versions           Version 3.13
	    ---------------------------------------------

            import @DocumentLayout      import @BasicSetup
	    import @CPrint              import @CPSetup
	    import @DiagramPrint        import @DiagSetup

         Sorry for the inconvenience, but the old system was inconsistent
	 and was tending towards an unsustainable combinatorial explosion
	 of setup files.  No changes *within* documents are needed, and
	 these new arrangements do not affect the content of the packages.
	 The user's guide documents it all.

Changes and new features introduced in Version 3.14 [released March 1999]

    Bug fixes
    "lout -PDF" now available as alternative to "lout -Z"

    "Abstract" word in tech reports now centred again by default
    Lout now builds composite characters - see Expert's Guide, under @Font

    *** IMPORTANT: ONE CHANGE THAT IS NOT UPWARDLY COMPATIBLE ***

    If you are using your own setup file, then it is likely to contain the
    line "@SysInclude { fontdefs }".  There is no longer a fontdefs file,
    there is now a fontdefs database, so you need to replace this line with
    "@SysDatabase @FontDef { fontdefs }".

    Arrowheads at opposite ends of a @Diag link now each have own style,
      length, and width (NB this is marginally not upward compatible)
    User's Guide now recommends "paint { none }" to get no paint, although
      the old "nopaint" value is still available for backward compatibility
    Any line anywhere can end in any of \n, \r, \r\n, or \n\r

    Nonpareil and Ruby programming languages supported by prg2lout
    Eight-bit characters considered printable by prg2lout

      plus @GraphDotDashed, @GraphDotDotDashed, @GraphDotDotDotDashed syms

    Things not done

      I may have promised to add dashed, dotted etc. options to @Tbl's
	rules, but existing code does not lend itself to it, so I haven't.

Changes and new features introduced in Version 3.30 [October 2004]

   Bug fixes (H. K. Man's fix for PDF links, '' in Python, crashing
     for some cases of "lout --option{value}")
   Fixed bug with large page sizes.  Lout stores object sizes in 32-bit
     integers, but smaller numbers (gap widths, shifts, character metrics
     etc.) in 16-bit integers.  The left parameter of @Wide and @High was
     erroneously being passed through a 16-bit variable.
   Added A2 to list of page types (it works, too)

   "@Graph style { grid }" replaces ticks in graphs with grid lines

   Things not done

      @CaptionGap not implementable since some gaps between figures and
	captions are not accessible.  Try @FigureCaptionFormat.
      Brazilian Portuguese declined on the grounds that it turned out
        virtually identical to Portuguese Portuguese (convince me...)
      I may have promised to add an "incontents" option to large-scale
        structure symbols, which would allow them to opt out of the table
	of contents.  On second thoughts I'm unwilling to do this.  I need
	to be convinced that Lout should encourage this strange thing.

Changes and new features introduced in Version 3.31 [August 2005]

   Bug fixes:
     Ludovic Courtes's fix for ligatures problem

   Hyphenation on in programming languages, using new "Programming @Language"
   New @DocInfo symbol (see User's Guide, Section 3.7)
   @Math symbol (Courtes) has now replaced @Eq in User's Guide; @Eq is
     still available for backward compatibility

   I had one report that prg2lout was returning non-zero intermittently
   during the formatting of the User's Guide.  I have not observed this
   myself.  Presumably there is an uninitialized variable somewhere.
   It's hard to do anything about this unless someone can get a core
   dump so we can find out where in prg2lout.c the crash occurred.

   Cichelli and Bader offered a patch to include PDF files by calling
   a freeware program to convert them to EPS files and including the
   EPS files.  I declined to include this in the standard release
   because I felt that it could be done outside Lout, and because the
   PDF support in Lout is not maintained and generally deprecated.

   Strictly speaking, turning hyphenation on in programming languages
   is not backward compatible.  I've done it because I have not been
   able to think of a case where it would cause trouble.  If you find
   a problem with it, please let me know.

Changes and new features introduced in Version 3.38 [October 2008]

   Bug fixes:
     Fixed my bungled installation of Bader's patch allowing EPS previews
     Fiddled with prg2lout.c hoping to fix its intermittent crash bug
   Converted "non-zero exit status of filter" from a fatal error to a
     warning, so the unfixed prg2lout error has fewer repercussions

Changes and new features introduced in Version 3.39 [September 2010]

   Bug fixes:
     Fixed a problem with @IndexBText
   Added copyright notices to many files, to satisfy the Savannah
     people.  There is no change in what is permitted.  Files that
     go to make up an output file are either public domain or else
     carry this additional wording, supplied by the Savannah people:
     "As a special exception, when this file is read by Lout when
     processing a Lout source document, you may use the result
     without restriction."

   Things not done

   It was suggested that using a version control system (in
     particular, svn) would be a good idea.  I thought about
     it but decided that there was too little change going on
     to make it worth my while, at the moment anyway.

Changes and new features introduced in Version 3.40 [June 2013]

   Bug fixes:
     MAX_STACK in z06.c increased (again) to 250.
     Rare crash at "env = SetEnv(res, env);" given truly horrible patch.
     @Pie totalweight default was not inherited from @PieSetup; fixed now.
     @DefinitionTitleFormat, @ClaimTitleFormat, @PropositionTitleFormat,
       @LemmaTitleFormat, @CorollaryTitleFormat, @ExampleTitleFormat fixed.
     Problem with eogonek in titles (Kamil Rytarowski, Uwe) fixed.
   JavaScript and Tcl languages added to prg2lout.c (Mark Summerfield).
   @Place symbol now available when setting setup file options.
   New version of @Graph with @GraphSetup symbol in setup file.  Should
     be 100% backward compatible, if not use @SysInclude { old_graph }.
   New ISOB4, ISOB5, JISB4, and JISB5 paper sizes.  The old B4 and B5
     sizes are still available unchanged, though now deprecated.
   New @Diag options: outlinecolour for nodes, pathcolour for links.
   I've also lightly revised the User's Guide, to remove some bad
     line and page breaks that had crept into the A4 version.

   Things not done

   Still no move to a version control system.  It just isn't worth my
     time.  If anyone wants to take it on, you have my blessing, but
     be warned that the copyright of hyphenation files is a swamp.

   Forematter (@Preface etc.) in books.  I have a suggestion from
     Joerg Jung about moving the @Abbreviations section into the
     forematter, and another from Mark Summerfield for a generic
     scheme (@ForeMatterA ... @ForeMatterE with user-selectable
     titles).  Rather than do that I would prefer one @ForeMatter
     symbol but allow a sequence of invocations of it, like we
     have now for @Chapter and @Appendix.  There is already an
     @AfterTitlePage symbol that can be used as a workaround.  I'm
     a bit at a loss so I've decided to do nothing for now.  However
     this could be looked at again.  Some discussion might help.

Changes and new features introduced in Version 3.42 [Dec 2020]

   3.42 has bug fixes, some small enhancements, and updated
     build scripts. Existing lout files should work unchanged
     and should produce identical output, except for slightly
     more accurate placement of some objects.
   Download 3.42 with
   wget https://github.com/william8000/lout/archive/3.42.tar.gz

   Support for embedding PDF and bitmapped images in lout.
     Embedding PDFs requires pdftops, see PDFTOPS_COM
     in externs.h.
     Embedding bitmapped images requires ImageMagick convert,
     see CONVERT_COM in externs.h.
     The embedding code is in z03.c.
   Small images are now placed more accurately.
     externs.h now defines ALT_SCALE_FACTOR_SHIFT for embedded
     images. Lout rounds the scale factor of images with
     trunc(SF * available_space / image_size).
     If a small image needed a scale factor of 25.9, lout would
     round it down to 25, which could leave the image short by
     a few points on an A4 or Letter size page.
     Increasing ALT_SCALE_FACTOR_SHIFT from 8 to 12 makes image
     placement more accurate at the expense of reducing the
     largest page from 148m to 9.2m.
     The calculations are in FixAndPrintObject() in z23.c.
   Improve accuracy of the CM unit. PS_PrintBeforeFirstPage() in
     z49.c now writes its value to 3 decimal places instead of
     rounded to an integer.
   Running 'make install' no longer requires creating or removing
     directories. The makefile now works cleanly on Linux with
     'make all' and repeated runs of 'make allinstall'.
   Reorganized library directory that supports multiple versions of
     lout. In the makefile, the default PREFIX is now /usr/local
     instead of /home/jeff. The default lib, doc, and man directories
     are now under $(PREFIX)/share/lout-$(VERSION)
   The makefile now adds more warnings in COPTS.
   The makefile now adds $(CFLAGS) to the lout link line.
   externs.h has USE_SYSTEM_MALLOC to use the operating system's
     malloc and USE_MALLOC_DEBUG to enabled malloc debugging.
     Both should normally be disabled (set to 0) but can be
     turned on to help locate memory allocation errors.
     Memory allocation in z29.c and in z31.c checks USE_SYSTEM_MALLOC.
   Add an 'al' debug option to enable all debug flags
     in DebugInit() in z27.c.
   Add support for segmented postscript files in z03.c by including
     a graphic with the syntax @name@start:end
     The file 'name' should have a shared postscript prolog, a null,
     a shared postscript trailer, and then byte offsets 'start' and
     'end' to identify the postscript segment to use.
   Add 'static' to several C functions that did not need to be global.
   Fix bad memory accesses in DisposeObject() in z07.c.
   Fix the fatal error "AdjustSize: Up(x) == x!".
     Initialize column and row forward and back pointers
     in CopyObject() in z07.c, in insert_split() in z08.c,
     in MinSize() in z12.c, and in BreakObject() in z13.c.
     The original code did not take into account that rotations
     need both column and row pointers initialized.
     The uninitialized values would trigger an assert in AdjustSize()
     in z16.c. AdjustSize() now prints a warning instead of exiting
     in case the initializations did not completely solve the problem.
   Fix a bad memory access to kerned_glyphs[] in z14.c.
   Fix possible memory overwrite in prg2lout.c
   New files:
     .gitignore to keep generated files out of git
     updateversion.sh to update the version number in lout source files
     complout.bat unmaintained script to compile lout in a dos box
     makelout.bat unmaintained script to build lout using complout.bat
     instlout.bat unmaintained script to install lout in a dos box
