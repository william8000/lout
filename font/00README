Directory lout/font - font metrics files

This directory contains Adobe Systems font metrics (formerly .AFM)
files for all the fonts mentioned in file lout/include/fontdefs.  These
files are the source of Lout's information about the height and width
of all characters.  The files are exactly as distributed publicly by
Adobe Systems except that erroneous ligature information has been
removed from the four Courier font files.

All file names have now been reduced to a maximum of 8 characters,
for portability to the DOS operating system.  Non-Latin1 fonts are
no longer distributed with the basic Lout distribution.
