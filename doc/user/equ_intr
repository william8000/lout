The Lout definitions for the @Code "@Eq" symbol are kept in a file called
{@Code "eq"}, which you must include at the start of your document if
eq.file @Index { @Code "eq" file }
you want equations, like this:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"@SysInclude { tab }"
"@SysInclude { eq }"
"@SysInclude { doc }"
"@Doc @Text @Begin"
"..."
"@End @Text"
}
This shows what to do if you want both tables and equations, but you
may leave out the line for tables if you don't want them.  Files of
definitions, like {@Code "tab"} and {@Code "eq"}, must be included
before the setup file, but may be included in any order.  Alternatively,
if you are using your own setup file, you may place the include commands
within it; the place to put them is clearly marked in all the standard
setup files.
@PP
With the @Code "eq" file included, you may write
@ID @Code "@Eq { ... }"
at any point in your document, and the symbols of @Code "@Eq" will be
available between the braces.  Any symbols available outside continue
to be available inside, which means that equations may be freely mixed
with other symbols, without restriction.
@PP
Equations may appear within a paragraph of text, or they may be
displayed.  {@Code "@Eq"}'s job is to produce an object containing the
equation; it neither knows nor cares where this equation goes.  To get
an equation within a paragraph, simply place @Code "@Eq { ... }" at the
desired point.  To prevent it spreading over two lines, use
{@Code "@OneCol @Eq { ... }"}.  To display an equation, use a display
symbol like @Code "@IndentedDisplay" or @Code "@CentredDisplay" 
(Section {@NumberOf displays}).  For example,
@ID @Code "@CentredDisplay @Eq { int supp pi on 0 sin ` x = 0 }"
produces
@CentredDisplay @Eq { int supp pi on 0 sin ` x = 0 }
There are also symbols for aligned and numbered displays, which are
very commonly used with equations.  These symbols are the subject of
Section {@NumberOf mathdisplays}.
@PP
In this chapter we show the Lout input at the left, and its
result at the right:
@ID {
@Code "@Eq { {x sup 2 + y sup 2} over 2 }"
|7ct
@Eq { {x sup 2 + y sup 2} over 2 }
}
Subsequent examples will omit the enclosing {@Code "@Eq { ... }"}.
