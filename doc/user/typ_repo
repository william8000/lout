@PP
To make a technical report, start off with the @Code "report" setup
reports. @Index { reports }
technical.reports. @Index { technical reports }
report. @Index @Code "@Report"
file and the @Code "@Report" symbol:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"@SysInclude { report }"
"@Report"
"    @Title {}"
"    @Author {}"
"    @Institution {}"
"    @DateLine { No }"
"    @CoverSheet { Yes }"
"    @InitialFont { Times Base 12p }"
"    @InitialBreak { hyphen adjust 1.2fx }"
"    @InitialLanguage { English }"
"    @PageHeaders { Simple }"
"    @FirstPageNumber { 1 }"
"    @ColumnNumber { 1 }"
"//"
}
This shows all the options of {@Code "@Report"} with their default
values.  As usual with options, they may be given in any order, and
only the ones whose values need to be changed need be given at all.  The
meaning of the @Code "//" symbol after the last option is beyond our
scope, but disaster will ensue if it is forgotten.
@PP
The @Code "@Title" option holds the title of the report.  It will be
printed using the @Code clines paragraph breaking style (Section
{@NumberOf paras}), which centres each line, so it makes sense
to have multi-line titles:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"@Report"
"    @Title {"
"The solution of real instances of"
"the timetabling problem"
"}"
"    ..."
}
With a multi-line title, each line after the first should begin
at the left margin, not indented.  It doesn't matter where the first
line begins, because space following an open brace is ignored.
@PP
The @Code "@Author" and @Code "@Institution" options hold the author's
name and institution or address, and will also be printed using the
@Code clines style.  If there are several authors but only one
institution, list all the authors in the @Code "@Author" option:
@ID @Code "@Author { Tim B. Cooper and Jeffrey H. Kingston }"
With more authors, or with more than one institution, it is best to
ignore the @Code "@Institution" option and place all the information
within the @Code "@Author" option, enclosing institution information
in @Code "@I" symbols.  In extreme cases, a table with columns of
authors might be necessary (Chapter {@NumberOf tables}).
@PP
@Code "@DateLine" may be set to {@Code No}, meaning no dateline,
{@Code Yes}, meaning print the current date, or anything else, which is
taken to be a date and printed:
@ID @Code "@DateLine { 4 July, 1776 }"
A good plan is to start off with @Code "@DateLine { Yes }" and
introduce a final date when the report is finalized.
@PP
The remaining options are a selection of setup file options (Section
{@NumberOf setup}) that frequently need to be changed.  If your changes
to the overall formatting are confined to these options, you can change
them here and avoid having your own setup file.  If you already have
your own setup file, change them in either place and omit them in
the other.
@PP
If the @Code "@CoverSheet" option is {@Code Yes}, an unnumbered cover
cover.sheet. @Index @Code "@CoverSheet"
sheet will be produced containing the title, author, institution,
abstract, and dateline.  Otherwise these things will appear on the
first page.
@PP
@Code "@InitialFont" is the font in which the bulk of the report will be
set, and should contain a family, a face, and a size.  The default
value selects the Times family, the Base face, and the 12 point size.
@PP
@Code "@InitialBreak" controls the behaviour of paragraph breaking in
the bulk of the report.  It should have three parts:  a paragraph
breaking style ({@Code adjust}, {@Code ragged}, etc.), an inter-line
spacing ({@Code "1.2fx"} for single spacing, {@Code "2.4fx"} for
double spacing, and so on), and either @Code "hyphen" or
@Code "nohyphen" for turning hyphenation on or off.
@PP
@Code "@InitialLanguage" determines the language of the bulk of the
report.
@PP
@Code "@PageHeaders" determines the appearance of page headers and
footers throughout the report.  Its value may be {@Code None},
{@Code Simple}, {@Code Titles}, or {@Code NoTitles}.  Section
{@NumberOf headers} has the details, but just briefly, {@Code None}
produces no page headers, {@Code Simple} produces a centred page number
between hyphens on every page except the cover sheet and the first
page, @Code Titles produces full running titles as in the present
document, and @Code "NoTitles" is like @Code "Titles" with the running
titles omitted, leaving just the page numbers.
@PP
@Code "@FirstPageNumber" is the page number given to the first page.
@PP
@Code "@ColumnNumber" is the number of columns per page in the bulk of
the report, and may be anything from {@Code 1} (the default value) to
{@Code 10}.  However, there is nothing analogous to the @Code "@FullWidth"
symbol of ordinary documents.  Instead, the cover sheet, title material,
and all figures and tables will be printed full width, and the rest will
be set in columns.  There is a separate @Code "@IndexColumnNumber" option
in the setup file which determines the number of columns in the index
(Section {@NumberOf indexes}).
@PP
After the compulsory {@Code "//"} comes an optional abstract:
abstract. @Index @Code "@Abstract"
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"@Abstract"
"    @Title { Abstract }"
"@Begin"
"@LP"
"..."
"@End @Abstract"
}
This will be printed either on the cover sheet or on the first page,
depending on the @Code "@CoverSheet" option of @Code "@Report" (see
above).  The default value of @Code "@Title" is `Abstract' in the
current language, so you can usually omit {@Code "@Title"}.
@PP
Next comes the body of the report in the form of a sequence of
sections:
section.reports @SubIndex { in reports }
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"@Section"
"    @Title { Introduction }"
"@Begin"
"@PP"
"..."
"@End @Section"
}
No @Code "@BeginSections" or @Code "@EndSections" symbols are needed.  The
beginsections.reports @SubIndex { in reports }
endsections.reports @SubIndex { in reports }
general rule is that you need these bracketing symbols when you are
inside something else, but not when you aren't.  Sections lie inside
@Code "@Text" in ordinary documents, but they don't lie inside anything
else in technical reports.
@PP
Each section may contain subsections, bracketed by
subsection.reports @SubIndex { in reports }
beginsubsections.reports @SubIndex { in reports }
endsubsections.reports @SubIndex { in reports }
@Code "@BeginSubSections" and {@Code "@EndSubSections"}:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"preceding text"
"@BeginSubSections"
"@SubSection ... @End @SubSection"
"@SubSection ... @End @SubSection"
"..."
"@SubSection ... @End @SubSection"
"@EndSubSections"
}
Within each subsection there may be sub-subsections, each introduced
by {@Code "@SubSubSection"}, with the whole sequence bracketed by
subsubsection.reports @SubIndex { in reports }
beginsubsubsections.reports @SubIndex { in reports }
endsubsubsections.reports @SubIndex { in reports }
@Code "@BeginSubSubSections" and {@Code "@EndSubSubSections"}:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"preceding text"
"@BeginSubSubSections"
"@SubSubSection ... @End @SubSubSection"
"@SubSubSection ... @End @SubSubSection"
"..."
"@SubSubSection ... @End @SubSubSection"
"@EndSubSubSections"
}
There are no sub-sub-subsections.
@PP
After the sections comes an optional sequence of appendices, each
introduced by @Code "@Appendix" in the usual way:
appendix.reports @SubIndex { in technical reports }
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"@Appendix"
"    @Title { Derivation of the renewal formula }"
"@Begin"
"@PP"
"..."
"@End @Appendix"
}
No @Code "@BeginAppendices" or @Code "@EndAppendices" symbols are needed,
beginappendices.reports @SubIndex { in reports }
endappendices.reports @SubIndex { in reports }
because (like the sections above) these appendices do not lie inside
any other large-scale structure symbol.  The appendices are numbered
A, B, C, etc., as is conventional for them.  Within each appendix
there may be a sequence of subappendices, obtained with the
@Code "@SubAppendix" symbol and bracketed by @Code "@BeginSubAppendices"
subappendix.reports @SubIndex { in reports }
beginsubappendices.reports @SubIndex { in reports }
endsubappendices.reports @SubIndex { in reports }
and {@Code "@EndSubAppendices"}:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"preceding text"
"@BeginSubAppendices"
"@SubAppendix ... @End @SubAppendix"
"@SubAppendix ... @End @SubAppendix"
"..."
"@SubAppendix ... @End @SubAppendix"
"@EndSubAppendices"
}
There are sub-subappendices following the same pattern, but no
subsubappendix.reports @SubIndex { in reports }
beginsubsubappendices.reports @SubIndex { in reports }
endsubsubappendices.reports @SubIndex { in reports }
sub-sub-subappendices.
@PP
The report ends with the last section or appendix; any reference list or
index will be appended automatically.  Although we have described how to
create reports as though everything was in one large file, in practice it
is much better to divide the report into multiple files, following the
method given in Section {@NumberOf organizing}.
@PP
In addition to the {@Code "@Title"} option, each large-scale structure
symbol ({@Code "@Abstract"}, {@Code "@Section"}, {@Code "@SubSection"},
{@Code "@SubSubSection"}, {@Code "@Appendix"}, {@Code "@SubAppendix"},
and {@Code "@SubSubAppendix"}) has a @Code "@Tag" option for cross
referencing (Section {@NumberOf cross}), an @Code "@InitialLanguage"
option for changing the language of that part of the document, and a
@Code "@RunningTitle" option which will be used in place of @Code "@Title"
in running headers if given.  This last is useful when the full title is
rather long.
@PP
The features described in other chapters are all available within
technical reports.  To get a table of contents, change the @Code
"@MakeContents" option in the setup file to {@Code Yes}; the rest is
automatic, and you don't need the @Code "@ContentsGoesHere" symbol from
ordinary documents.  To get an index, again you need only change the
@Code "@MakeIndex" setup file option to {@Code Yes}.  Endnotes and
references appear at the end of the report.  Figures and tables are
numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.
@PP
Within the @Code "report" setup file there is a @Code "@ReportLayout"
symbol whose options control the appearance of features specific to
report.layout @Index @Code "@ReportLayout"
reports (in other words, the features described in this section).  Section
{@NumberOf setup} explains setup files and their options in general; here
is a representative sample of these options, showing their default values:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"@Use { @ReportLayout"
"    # @CoverSheet { Yes }"
"    # @DateLine { No }"
"    # @SectionNumbers { Arabic }"
"    # @SectionHeadingFont { Bold }"
"    # @SectionGap { 2.00v }"
"    # @SectionInContents { Yes }"
"}"
}
@Code "@CoverSheet" and @Code "@DateLine" are as for {@Code "@Report"};
you can set them in either place as you prefer.  The other four options
control the appearance of sections, and there are similar options for
controlling the other large-scale structure symbols.
@PP
@Code "@SectionNumbers" determines how sections will be numbered, and may
be @Code { None }, @Code { Arabic }, @Code { Roman }, @Code { UCRoman },
@Code { Alpha }, or @Code { UCAlpha }.  The default value is @Code Arabic
for sections, and also for all large-scale structure symbols except
appendices, for which it is {@Code UCAlpha}.  This produces the appendices
numbered in upper-case letters (A, B, C, etc.) that were mentioned earlier.
@PP
@Code "@SectionHeadingFont" is the font used for section headings.  The
default value shown above produces the bold face from the family of the
initial font.  A family name and size is acceptable here as well:
@ID @Code "@SectionHeadingFont { Helvetica Base +2p }"
produces section headings in the Helvetica font, two points larger
than the initial font size.
@PP
@Code "@SectionGap" determines how much space is left blank between
sections; the default value is twice the initial inter-line
spacing.  @Code "@SectionInContents" determines whether or not an
entry is made in the table of contents for each section; it may be
@Code Yes or {@Code No}.
@End @Section
