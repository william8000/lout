A note can be placed in the left margin by typing
leftnote. @Index @Code "@LeftNote"
marginnote. @Index { margin notes }
@ID {
@Code "@LeftNote { A left note. }"
@LeftNote { A left note. }
}
after the word that the note refers to.  The note will appear in the
margin at the same height on the page as that word, unless that would
cause it to overlap a previous margin note, in which case it will be
shifted downwards (but never onto the next page).  The note may be an
arbitrary Lout object; for example, you might type
@ID {
@Code "@LeftNote @I { A left note. }"
@LeftNote @I { A left note. }
}
to make your note come out in italics.
@PP
You can get a note in the right margin by using @Code "@RightNote"
@RightNote { A right note. }
rightnote. @Index @Code "@RightNote"
instead of {@Code "@LeftNote"}.  To get a note in the outer margin
(left on even pages, right on odd pages), use {@Code "@OuterNote"};
@OuterNote { An outer note. }
outernote. @Index @Code "@OuterNote"
and for the opposite, use {@Code "@InnerNote"}.
@InnerNote { An inner note. }
@PP
By default, Lout produces margins that are 2.5 centimetres wide, which
is not really enough to accommodate reasonable margin notes.  To
change these margins, you need to change options in the setup file, as
explained in Section {@NumberOf margins}.
@PP
The appearance of the margin notes themselves is also determined by
options in the setup file (for a general introduction to setup files
and their options, consult Section {@NumberOf setup}).  Here are
the options and their default values:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"@MarginNoteFont { 0.80f }"
"@MarginNoteBreak { ragged 1.10fx }"
"@MarginNoteHGap { 0.5c }"
"@MarginNoteVGap { 1.00v }"
"@MarginNoteWidth { 1.50c }"
}
@Code "@MarginNoteFont" determines the font used; the default value
produces the current font scaled to 0.8 times the current size; you
could write @Code "Slope 0.80f" to get italic notes, and so
on.  @Code "@MarginNoteBreak" is the paragraph breaking style to
use, similar to the @Code "@InitialBreak" setup file option.
@PP
@Code "@MarginNoteHGap" determines how far away from the
adjacent text column the margin note will appear; the default
value is 0.5 centimetres.  @Code "@MarginNoteVGap" is the minimum
vertical separation between margin notes (i.e. it determines how
far downwards a note will be shifted to avoid the previous
one).  @Code "@MarginNoteWidth" determines the width of the column
in which margin notes (both left and right) are set; the default
value of 1.5 centimetres is suited to the 2.5 centimetre page margins
that are the default, but if you widen the page margins you will be
able to increase @Code "@MarginNoteWidth" too.
@PP
Left notes extend into the left margin a total distance of
@Code "@MarginNoteHGap" plus {@Code "@MarginNoteWidth"}, and it is
up to you to make sure that this does not put them off
the page.  Similar remarks apply to right notes.  And since notes
are never shifted to the next page, only downwards, there is also
a risk that a note will be shifted off the bottom of the page, if
it is very long or if preceding notes obstruct it.  Again, it is
up to you to avoid this problem by keeping your notes small and not
too close together.
@PP
Margin notes inside footnotes, figures and tables work well.  Margin
notes in multi-column documents are disastrous unless used very
sparingly.  Margin notes do not appear in plain text output
(Section {@NumberOf plain}).
