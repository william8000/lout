@PP
We have just seen that the @Code "@CP" symbol has many options for
changing the appearance of the C text.  However, most people would
not want to have a different style for every C text in their document;
they want to define the style once at the start, and have all their
C texts come out in that style without laboriously setting options
on every @Code "@CP" symbol.  This is done by copying the setup file
and changing it.
@PP
For general information about how to make your own setup file, consult
Section {@NumberOf setup}.  The options that determine the default
values are in the @Code "@CPSetup" @Code "@Use" clause near the end of
cprint. @Index @Code "@CPSetup"
the @Code "cpsetup." setup file:
@ID @Code @Tab
   vmargin { 0.5vx }
   @Fmta { @Col A ! @Col B ! @Col C}
   @Fmtb { @Col { "    #" A } ! @Col { "{" B } ! @Col "}" }
{
@Rowa A { "@Use {  @CPSetup" }
@Rowb A { "style" } B { fixed         }

@Rowa 
@Rowb A { "fixedfont" }			B { Courier  }
@Rowb A { "fixedstrings" }		B { Base  }

@Rowb A { "symboloperators" }		B { Base          }
@Rowb A { "symbolsize" }		B { 1.0f          }
@Rowb A { "symbolline" }		B { 1.0vx         }
@Rowb A { "symboltabin" }		B { 8		  }
@Rowb A { "symboltabout" }		B { 3f		  }

@Rowa A { "}" }
}
These show the default font families, font faces, font sizes, line
spacings, and tab settings in force for the three styles, and also that
the default style is {@Code "fixed"}.  Notice that the font family name
for @Code "fixed" style is {@Code "Courier"}, but for the other styles is
empty.  This causes the @Code "fixed" style to always switch to Courier,
and the other styles to use the same font family as in the surrounding
document.
@PP
To change a default value, delete the preceding @Code "#" and change the
part between braces.  For example, suppose you are happy with @Code "fixed"
except that you want bold keywords.  Then one line needs to be changed, to
@ID @Code "fixedkeywords { Bold }"
Or suppose you like @Code "varying" as it stands, but would like it to be
the default style rather than {@Code "fixed"}.  Again, only one line needs
to be changed, to {@Code "style { varying }"}.
