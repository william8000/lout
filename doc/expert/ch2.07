The behaviour of galleys and their targets, as described in Section
galley.feature.in.detail @SubIndex { in detail }
targets.in.detail @SubIndex { in detail }
{@NumberOf galleys}, can be summarized in three laws:
@DP
{@I {First Law}}:  The first target is the closest invocation of the
target symbol, either preceding or following the invocation point of the
galley as required, which has sufficient space to receive the first
component;
@DP
{@I {Second Law}}:  Each subsequent target is the closest invocation of
the target symbol, following the previous target and lying within the same
galley, which has sufficient space to receive the first remaining component;
@DP
{@I {Third Law}}:  A receptive symbol that does not receive at least one
component of any galley is replaced by @@Null.
@DP
The terms `closest,' `preceding,' and `following' refer to position in
the final printed document.  This section explains the operation of
these laws in Basser Lout.
@PP
When a galley cannot be fitted into just one target, Lout must find
points in the galley where it can be split in two.  The object lying
between two neighbouring potential split points is called a @I component
component @Index { Components of a galley }
of the galley.  By definition, a component cannot be split.
@PP
To determine the components of a galley, expand all symbols other than
recursive and receptive ones, discard all @@Font, @@Break, @@Space,
@@SetColor, @@SetColour, and @@Language symbols, perform paragraph
breaking as required, and discard all redundant braces.  Then view the
galley as a sequence of one or more objects separated by vertical
concatenation symbols; these are the components and split points.  For
example, given the definition
@ID @Code {
"def @Section into { @SectionPlace&&preceding }"
"    named @Title {}"
"    right @Body"
"{"
"    15p @Font { @Title //0.7f }"
"    //"
"    @Body"
"}"
}
the galley
@ID @Code {
"@Section"
"    @Title { Introduction }"
"{ This is a subject that really"
"needs no introduction. }"
}
becomes
@ID @Code {
"Introduction"
"//0.7f"
"{}"
"//"
"This is a subject that really needs"
"//1vx"
"no introduction."
}
with four components.  If @Code "@Body" was preceded by @Code "|1.0c" in
the definition, the result would be
@ID @Code {
"Introduction"
"//0.7f"
"{}"
"//"
"|1.0c { This is a subject that really needs //1vx no introduction. }"
}
and now @Code "//1vx" is buried within one component and is not a
potential split point.  In fact, in this case the broken paragraph as
a whole is enclosed in @@OneRow.  This highlights a deficiency of
Basser Lout:  an indented paragraph cannot be split.
@PP
The lines of a paragraph become separate components if the paragraph
occupies an entire component before breaking; otherwise they are
enclosed in a @@OneRow symbol within one component.  The same is true of
incoming components of other galleys.  If a @@Galley symbol occupies an
entire component by the rules above, then the incoming components that
replace it become components of their new home:
@ID @Tab
  @Fmta { @Col @Code A ! @Col lines @Break B ! @Col @Code C }
{
@Rowa
   A {
"An example"
"//0.5c"
"@Galley"
"//0.5c"
"@SomethingList"
}
  B {
""
@Eq { ==> }
}
   C {
"An example"
"//0.5c"
"Incoming components"
"//0.2c"
"from some other galley"
"//0.5c"
"@SomethingList"
}
}
Otherwise the incoming components are grouped within a @@OneRow symbol
and lie within one component.
@PP
This distinction has a marked effect on the vertical concatenation
b.unit.use @SubIndex { use in @Code "//1.1b" }
symbol {@Code "//1.1b"}, which calls for more space than is available
(Section {@NumberOf concatenation}).  There is no room for this symbol
within any component, so it will force a split and be discarded in that
case.  But it can be promoted to between two components.
@PP
Components may be separated by @Code "/" as well as by {@Code "//"},
giving rise to column mark alignment between adjacent components:
@ID @ShowVMark {
@HContract @GreyBox { 1c @Wide ^| 1c @Wide 0.6c @High }
/0.3c
@HContract @GreyBox { 2c @Wide 0.6c @High }
/0.3c
@HContract @GreyBox { 0.5c @Wide ^| 0.8c @Wide 0.6c @High }
}
When aligned components are promoted into different targets, the meaning
of alignment becomes very doubtful.  For example, what if the targets
mark.alignment.in.detail @SubIndex { in detail }
are in different columns of one page, or what if one lies within
{@Code "90d @Rotate"}?
@PP
The truth is that @Code "/" causes all the objects that share a mark to
have equal width:
@ID @ShowVMark {
@TightBox @HContract @GreyBox { 1c @Wide ^| 1c @Wide 0.6c @High }
/0.3c
@TightBox @HContract @GreyBox { 2c @Wide 0.6c @High }
/0.3c
@TightBox @HContract @GreyBox { 0.5c @Wide ^| 0.8c @Wide 0.6c @High }
}
This is a consequence of the `as wide as possible' rule (Section
{@NumberOf size}).  Mark alignment occurs {@I incidentally}, whenever
the fragments are placed into similar contexts.
@PP
In this connection we must also consider the special case of a @@Galley
symbol which shares its column mark with some other object:
@ID @Code {
"@Galley"
"/0.2c"
"@SomethingList"
}
(The @@Galley may or may not occupy an entire component; that doesn't
matter here.)  If incoming components are separated by @Code "//" rather
than by {@Code "/"}, the meaning is so doubtful that this is forbidden.  In
fact, a galley whose components replace such a @@Galley must have a
single column mark running its full length; that is, its components must
all share a single column mark.  This mark will be merged with the
column mark passing through each @@Galley that these components replace;
all the objects on the resulting merged mark will have equal width.
@PP
The root galley, where everything collects immediately prior to output,
root.galley.in.detail @SubIndex { in detail }
is created automatically, not by a definition.  Its target is the output
file, and its object is the entire input, which typically looks like this:
@ID @Code {
"@PageList"
"//"
"@Text {"
"  Body text of the document ..."
"}"
}
where @Code "@PageList" expands to a sequence of pages containing
@Code "@TextPlace" symbols (see Section {@NumberOf definitions}), and
@Code "@Text" is a galley:
@ID @Code {
"def @TextPlace { @Galley }"
""
"def @Text into { @TextPlace&&preceding }"
"    right x"
"{"
"    x"
"}"
}
The spot vacated by a galley -- its invocation point -- becomes a @@Null
object, so this root galley is effectively @Code "@PageList" alone, as
required.  The @Code "@Text" galley will find its first target preceding
its invocation point, within {@Code "@PageList"}.
@PP
Printing {@PageMark rootg} the root galley on the output file is somewhat problematical,
root.galley.printing @SubIndex { printing of }
because Lout has no way of knowing how large the paper is.  Basser Lout
simply prints one root galley component per page (except it skips
components of height zero), and the user is responsible for ensuring
that each component is page-sized.
@PP
Basser Lout will promote a component only after any receptive symbols
components.promotion @SubIndex { promotion of }
promotion @Index { Promotion of components }
within it have been replaced, either by galleys or by @@Null, since
until then the component is not complete.  A component which shares a
mark with following components is held up until they are all complete,
since until then their width is uncertain.
@PP
Consider a page with @Code "@TextPlace" and @Code "@FootSect" receptive
symbols.  The rule just given will prevent the page from being printed
until @Code "@TextPlace" is replaced by body text, quite rightly; but
@Code "@FootSect" will also prevent its printing, even when there are no
footnotes.
@PP
Basser Lout is keen to write out pages as soon as possible, to save memory,
and it cannot afford to wait forever for non-existent footnotes.  A variant
of the galley concept, called a {@I {forcing galley}},
forcing.galley @Index { Forcing galley } {@PageMark forcing}
is introduced to solve this problem.  A forcing galley is defined like this:
@ID @Code {
"def @Text force into { @TextPlace&&preceding }"
"   ..."
}
and so on.  When such a galley replaces a @@Galley symbol, Lout replaces
every receptive symbol preceding the @@Galley by @@Null, thus ensuring that
as soon as text enters a page, for example, everything up to and including
the preceding page can be printed.  This does not take care of the very last
page, but Basser Lout replaces all receptive symbols by @@Null when it realizes
that its input has all been read, thus allowing the last page to print.
@PP
A forcing galley causes the Third Law to be applied earlier than
expected, and this creates two problems.  First, the replacement by
@@Null may be premature:  a galley may turn up later wanting one of the
defunct targets.  Such galleys (entries in tables of contents are
typical examples) are copied into the cross reference database and read
in during the next run just before their targets are closed, and so they
find their targets in the end.  Care must be taken to ensure that
large galleys such as chapters and sections do not have defunct targets,
since the cost of copying them to and from the database is unacceptably high.
@PP
A @Code "following" galley may fail to find a first target lying in a
following component of the same galley as its invocation point.  This is
a deficiency of Basser Lout, which occurs if the target has not been
read from input at the time the galley tries to find it.  A workaround
is to use a @Code "preceding" galley instead, defined like this:
@ID @Code {
"def @AGalley into { @AGalleyPlace&&preceding }"
"    right @Body"
"{"
"    //1.1b"
"    @Body"
"}"
}
and invoked like this:
@ID @Code {
"@AGalleyPlace | @AGalley { content of galley }"
"//"
"..."
"@AGalleyPlace"
}
The first @Code "@AGalleyPlace" receives only the initial empty object,
since the @Code "//1.1b" forces a split; and the Second Law puts Basser
Lout on the right track thereafter.
